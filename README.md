## Description

This application allows a user to generate a well-formatted html page, styled by CSS, that displays all their team members with relevant information for each role (manager, engineer and intern). It uses inquirer for command line user input and contains a suite of tests that employ Jest to test its class constructors for the various employee roles. It's main index.js file uses the principles of modular devlopment to seperate its functions and operations into discrete code blocks for clarity and for debugging purposes.

I benefitted from a tutoring session with David Elutilo who motivated the modular development in the index.js file and also provided inspiration for using arrays to store and retrieve data passed in from the enquirer prompts.
